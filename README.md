# MOVE

### Macintosh Orchestrator of Visual Ease

YA window manager for MacOS, inspired by annoyingly strict cutoff dates to pay for "so-so" software in existing similar applications. I intend and hope to continue building and adding features to this app, to make it the best and most flexible, customizeable, and easy-to-use window manager and desktop customization software offered for MacOS (it is not that today). Welcome to MOVE 0.1, in its infancy, and in a trans between vibe coding and pure brute force. Look forward to frequent updates and new features! Next up: a customizable grid system that beats all the others, and potentially some pretty colors to put on your Macintosh personal computer.

## Features

- Save window positions and sizes for all open applications
- Applications holding a window position in a layout are automatically reopened.
- Restore entire window layouts instantly (actually relatively slowly as it stands). Customize hotkeys (such as cmd + U) for on-the-fly layout restoration.
- Optional desktop icon positions - keep files you need close for the task you're doing. (Not supported in MacOS 26, feature may go away).
- Multiple saved layouts
- Hotkey programming directly in the layout list.
- Tiling solution. Move windows to a grid of 4, 8, or 12 (naming under reconsideration). Choose "Upper," "Middle," or "Lower" to allow only one row (divided by the number of tiles selected - needs some TLC here, but it's working well. Next on my list.)
- MOVE can now live in the menu bar, or in the dock. Up to you. 

## Requirements

- macOS (requires Accessibility permissions). Tested only on 26 thus far 
## Installation

Coming Soon to the Mac App Store, in the Releases section here, or grab the source code and have a hay day! Contributions are welcome! As mentioned, the codebase is somewhat brute-force. I'd love some input on proper APIs for these tasks that I have fallbacks for.

## Roadmap
* Add customization to grids, allow granular control over where windows fly, with multiple hotkeys for each.
* Add other desktop customization features for colors, backgrounds (neon or whatever the crap Apple's calling it now. Liquid ooze...)

* System monitor widgets or other medium - others are shitting the bed on this simple concept.
* Add testing for previous OS's
* Add a help section, feedback form
* AI analysis of your weird desktop habits (We do not collect ANY telemetry, data, or system information. None, ever.)

## Usage

1. Grant Accessibility permissions when prompted
2. Arrange your windows and optionally desktop icons as desired
3. Click "Save Layout" and give it a name
4. Optionally include desktop icons with the checkbox.
4. Grant some more permissions for Screen Recording (when icons are included).
5. Restore your layout anytime by selecting it from the list. If desktop icons were included, they'll automatically MOVE! (Daah! He said it!)

## Who the F&@# are you!?
I'm Aaron Rohrbacher. Hi there. I'm a principal-level DevOps and full-stack software engineer, specializing in digging applications out of the weirdest, most deprecated, unreadable, and seemingly impossible trenches you'll ever come across. I didn't necessarily pick that path myself - I provided one too many creative solutions to bring GOOD CODE that has simply been (often criminally and offensively) neglected back to life. It's provided me a career that I truly love... once I figure it out, anyway. I thrive on collaboration and community learning. I get weird and likely unhealthy thrills out of making old code, frameworks, etc. work in new language-agnostic ways. I also play the saxophone. Good day, then.
